    `The detected video may involve abuse-related actions.
    Abuse can be verbal, emotional, or physical.
    It often includes intentional harm inflicted on a victim.
    The victim may display distress or defensive behavior.
    There might be aggressive body language or shouting.
    Such scenes usually lack mutual consent or context of play.
    These actions are violations of basic human rights.
    It is important to report such behavior to authorities.
    Detection helps in early intervention and protection.
    Please verify with human oversight for further action.`,
  "assault": 
    `Assault involves a physical attack or aggressive encounter.
    This may include punching, kicking, or pushing actions.
    The victim may be seen retreating or being overpowered.
    There is usually a visible conflict or threat present.
    Such behavior is dangerous and potentially life-threatening.
    Immediate attention from security or authorities is critical.
    Assault detection can help prevent further escalation.
    The video may include violent gestures or weapons.
    Please proceed with care while reviewing such footage.
    Confirm with experts before initiating legal steps.`,
  "arson": 
    `This video likely captures an incident of arson.
    Arson is the criminal act of intentionally setting fire.
    You may see flames, smoke, or ignition devices.
    Often, it targets property like buildings or vehicles.
    Arson can lead to massive destruction and danger to life.
    There might be a rapid spread of fire visible.
    Suspects may appear to flee the scene post-ignition.
    These cases require immediate fire and law response.
    Check for signs of accelerants or premeditated setup.
    This detection must be validated with caution.`,
  "arrest": 
    `The scene likely depicts a law enforcement arrest.
    An arrest involves restraining a suspect or individual.
    You may see officers using handcuffs or other tools.
    The individual may be cooperating or resisting.
    It could be in public or private settings.
    Often, the suspect is guided or pushed into a vehicle.
    The presence of uniforms or badges may be evident.
    These scenarios may follow legal procedures.
    Misidentification is possible â€” confirm context.
    Verify with official reports before assuming guilt.`
